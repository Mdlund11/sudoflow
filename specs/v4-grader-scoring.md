The Taxonomy of Logical Complexity: An Exhaustive Analysis of the Sudoku Explainer Rating System1. Introduction: The Deterministic Complexity of SudokuThe game of Sudoku, typically viewed as a recreational logic puzzle, represents a specific instance of the exact cover problem within the broader field of combinatorial mathematics. While a 9x9 grid offers a finite state space, the computational pathways required to traverse from a given set of clues to a unique solution vary wildly in algorithmic complexity. This variance is not merely a function of the number of empty cells, but rather a reflection of the depth of the logical inference trees required to resolve ambiguity. To quantify this difficulty in a manner that parallels human cognitive load, the community and developers have converged on the Sudoku Explainer (SE) rating system.Unlike brute-force backtracking algorithms, which solve puzzles by exhaustively traversing decision trees without logical insight, the Sudoku Explainer algorithm attempts to solve puzzles using a strictly ordered hierarchy of constructive heuristics. The "difficulty" of a puzzle, under this framework, is defined not by the average difficulty of steps, nor by the time taken to solve, but by the Explainer Rating (ER): the numerical value of the single most complex logical technique required to progress the puzzle.1This report provides a definitive, exhaustive analysis of the Sudoku Explainer difficulty scale, ranging from the trivial deductions of the 1.0 rating to the recursive event horizons of the 12.0+ tier. It focuses specifically on the exact values assigned to specific pattern recognitions and the algorithmic rules governing the high-complexity domain (6.6+), where static pattern recognition gives way to dynamic implication networks.2. The Elementary Spectrum: Constraint Propagation (1.0 – 2.9)The foundation of the SE rating system lies in "Direct Logic." These are techniques that can be executed by examining a single unit (row, column, or box) or the immediate interaction between two units. Algorithmically, these steps require a lookahead depth of zero or one—they are immediate consequences of the Sudoku rules.2.1 The Hidden vs. Naked Dichotomy (1.0 – 2.3)A peculiar characteristic of the SE system, often counterintuitive to novice solvers, is the rating inversion between "Hidden" and "Naked" singles. In human cognitive terms, scanning a box to see that a '5' can only go in one spot (Hidden Single) is often perceived as easier than scanning a specific cell to eliminate eight other candidates (Naked Single). SE formalizes this intuition into exact values.1.0: Single Candidate / Last Value. This is the trivial state where a unit has only one empty cell. It is the algorithmic floor.21.2: Hidden Single (Block). The algorithm scans 3x3 boxes first. If a digit $d$ has only one valid position in box $B$, it is assigned 1.2. The prioritization of the block over rows/columns reflects the visual dominance of the 3x3 grid in human processing.11.5: Hidden Single (Row/Column). Finding a hidden single in a line is rated higher (1.5) than in a block. This 0.3 delta quantifies the increased difficulty of scanning linear arrays of 9 cells compared to the compact 3x3 box.2Conversely, Naked Singles are rated at 2.3. This relatively high rating for a fundamental technique arises from the solver's internal logic: finding a Naked Single implies that one has implicitly or explicitly accounted for (and eliminated) all other candidates in that cell's peers. Thus, the Naked Single is the culmination of negative constraints, whereas the Hidden Single is the identification of a positive constraint.22.2 Direct Intersection Logic (1.7 – 2.8)The "Direct" modifier in SE terminology (e.g., ratings 1.7, 1.9, 2.0, 2.5) refers to techniques that allow a placement or elimination without the need for full candidate notation (pencil marks). These are ratings assigned to puzzles solvable by "visual" logic.RatingTechniqueAlgorithmic Definition1.7Direct PointingA candidate for digit $d$ in a block is restricted to a single row/column. This "points" to the rest of the line, allowing the solver to place a digit in that line immediately (in a direct context).21.9Direct ClaimingThe inverse of pointing: A candidate in a row/column is restricted to a single block, "claiming" that position and eliminating the candidate from the rest of the block.22.0Direct Hidden PairTwo digits $\{d_1, d_2\}$ appear in only two cells of a block. In a "direct" context, this leads immediately to a solution step without managing the full candidate list.22.5Direct Hidden TripletThree digits restricted to three cells in a block. The combinatorial expansion from pair to triplet warrants a 0.5 rating increase.2Once the solver assumes full candidate notation is required (the threshold for "Fiendish" or "Hard" in many newspaper classifications), the same logic types reappear with higher ratings:2.6: Pointing Pairs/Triples.2.8: Claiming Pairs/Triples.This distinctions (1.7 vs 2.6) underscore that SE measures not just the logical validity of a move, but the context in which it is found—penalizing the necessity of candidate management.3. Intermediate Complexity: Subsets and Wings (3.0 – 4.4)The 3.0 to 4.4 range encompasses the domain of "Locked Sets" and "Fish" patterns. Algorithmically, these techniques shift from scanning for single digits to analyzing the intersections of sets. The complexity class here is defined by the number of variables (candidates) and the number of constraints (cells/units) involved.3.1 Subset Logic (3.0 – 4.0)The SE system applies a consistent penalty for the "Naked" visibility of a subset versus the "Hidden" visibility.3.0: Naked Pair. Two cells in a unit contain exactly the subset $\{d_1, d_2\}$. This allows the elimination of $d_1, d_2$ from all other cells in that unit.23.4: Hidden Pair. Two digits appear only in two cells within a unit, but are masked by noise candidates. The 0.4 difficulty premium over the Naked Pair reflects the search space: finding a Hidden Pair requires analyzing $C(9, 2)$ combinations of digits, whereas a Naked Pair requires analyzing cell contents.23.6: Naked Triplet. The complexity scales with set size.4.0: Hidden Triplet. Again, a 0.4 premium over the Naked variant.5.0: Naked Quad.5.4: Hidden Quad.3.2 The Fish Family (3.2 – 5.2)"Fish" patterns (X-Wings, Swordfish, Jellyfish) represent single-digit patterns where the candidate positions in $N$ rows are perfectly covered by $N$ columns (or vice versa). SE rates these based on the dimension $N$.3.2: X-Wing ($N=2$). The fundamental 2D fish pattern.3.8: Swordfish ($N=3$).5.2: Jellyfish ($N=4$).The non-linear jump from Swordfish (3.8) to Jellyfish (5.2) suggests that SE considers 4-dimensional constraints significantly harder to visualize, potentially due to the exponential increase in the number of candidate configurations to check ($C(9,4)$ rows vs $C(9,3)$).23.3 Bent Wings (4.2 – 4.4)The XY-Wing and XYZ-Wing introduce the concept of "bent" relationships, where three cells (a pivot and two pincers) interact across multiple units.4.2: XY-Wing. A pivot cell $\{A,B\}$ sees pincers $\{A,C\}$ and $\{B,C\}$. Any cell seeing both pincers cannot contain $C$.4.4: XYZ-Wing. The pivot contains $\{A,B,C\}$. The logic is similar but weaker, requiring the elimination target to see the pivot and both pincers.24. The Uniqueness Singularity: Structural Analysis (4.5 – 6.2)Ratings between 4.5 and 6.2 are dominated by Uniqueness Techniques. These strategies rely on the meta-constraint that a valid Sudoku puzzle must have exactly one solution. If a specific configuration of candidates (a "Deadly Pattern") were to exist, it would allow for two or more valid solutions (e.g., swapping digits in a rectangle). To prevent this, logical eliminations are made.The SE system's handling of uniqueness is controversial among purists who prefer "constructive" logic (proving the solution exists) over "destructive" logic (proving non-uniqueness is impossible). However, SE embraces these patterns fully, assigning them distinct values based on the complexity of the "avoidance" logic.44.1 Unique Rectangles (UR)The standard Deadly Pattern is four cells forming a rectangle in two rows, two columns, and two blocks, containing the candidates $\{a, b\}$. If this state is reached, the puzzle is invalid.4.5: UR Type 1. The simplest avoidance. One corner of the rectangle has extra candidates $\{a, b, x, y\}$. If this cell were $\{a, b\}$, the deadly pattern would form. Thus, $\{a, b\}$ can be eliminated from this corner.44.5: UR Type 2. Two corners share an extra candidate $x$. To avoid the deadly pattern, one of these corners must be $x$. Thus, $x$ can be eliminated from any cell that sees both corners.24.6: UR Type 3 with Naked Pair / Hidden Triplet.4.8: UR Type 3 with Naked Quad.4.5 - 5.0: This range covers various permutations, including Type 4 (Conjugate Pairs) and Type 5 (Diagonal Non-Naked).24.2 Bivalue Universal Grave (BUG)The BUG is a global deadly pattern. It arises when every unsolved cell in the grid has exactly two candidates, and every candidate appears exactly twice in every row, column, and box. This state implies the puzzle has 0 or 2 solutions.5.6: BUG Type 1 (BUG+1). This occurs when the grid is a BUG except for one cell which has three candidates. To avoid the BUG (and ensuring a unique solution), that cell must be the extra digit.75.7: BUG Type 2.5.8 - 6.1: BUG Type 3. This involves a BUG pattern that interacts with a Naked subset (Pair, Triplet, Quad) to force a resolution.BUG w/ Naked Pair: 5.8BUG w/ Naked Triplet: 5.9BUG w/ Naked Quad: 6.0.24.3 Aligned Pair Exclusion (6.2)At 6.2, we encounter Aligned Pair Exclusion (APE). This technique is a bridge between intersection logic and chaining. It involves analyzing two cells within an intersection (e.g., a box/row overlap) and determining that a specific pair of candidates cannot exist simultaneously because it would exhaust available spots for other numbers in the constituent units. Its high rating reflects the combinatorial difficulty of checking valid permutations for cell pairs.25. The Algorithmic Rules of Chaining (6.5 – 7.5)The transition from 6.5 to 7.0 marks a fundamental shift in the nature of difficulty. Below 6.5, difficulty is largely defined by the type of pattern (e.g., "Is it a Fish? Is it a UR?"). Above 6.5, difficulty is defined by the topology and length of implication chains. The SE algorithm generates these ratings dynamically based on node counting.5.1 Definitions: Strong and Weak LinksTo understand the rating rules, one must define the components of these chains:Strong Link: If candidate $A$ is false, $B$ must be true. (Occurs in bivalue cells or units with only two positions for a digit).Weak Link: If candidate $A$ is true, $B$ must be false. (Occurs when peers share a constraint).An Alternating Inference Chain (AIC) sequences these links ($A \Rightarrow B \Rightarrow C \dots$) to prove a contradiction or a verity.5.2 Chain Classification and Exact RatingsSudoku Explainer classifies chains into Bidirectional Cycles (Continuous Nice Loops) and Forcing Chains (Discontinuous Loops / AICs). The rating is a function of the number of nodes (steps) in the chain.5.2.1 Bidirectional Cycles (Loops)These are continuous loops where every node is strongly and weakly linked to its neighbors. The logic propagates in both directions.6.5: Bidirectional Cycle (X-Cycle or Y-Cycle) with 1 to 4 nodes.6.7: Bidirectional Y-Cycle with 7 to 8 nodes.7.0: Bidirectional Y-Cycle with 17 to 24 nodes.The logarithmic scaling of the rating (increasing by ~0.1 to 0.3 as node count doubles) reflects the exponential difficulty for a human to maintain the chain in working memory.25.2.2 Forcing Chains (X-Chains and XY-Chains)These are non-looping chains used to eliminate candidates. An X-Chain involves a single digit; an XY-Chain involves multiple digits but only bivalue cells.6.6: Forcing X-Chain with 5 to 6 nodes. (This specific rating often captures the "Turbot Fish" pattern).6.8: Forcing X-Chain with 9 to 12 nodes.6.9: Forcing X-Chain with 13 to 16 nodes.7.0: Forcing Chain (General) with 1 to 4 nodes.7.1: Forcing Chain with 5 to 6 nodes.7.2: Forcing Chain with 7 to 8 nodes.7.3: Forcing Chain with 9 to 12 nodes.7.4: Forcing Chain with 13 to 16 nodes.7.5: Forcing Chain with 17 to 24 nodes.2Algorithmic Insight: Note that a short general Forcing Chain (7.0) is rated harder than a medium X-Chain (6.6). This implies that SE weights multi-digit logic (changing numbers between nodes) as significantly harder than single-digit logic, even if the single-digit chain is longer.5.3 Nishio Forcing Chains (7.5 – 8.5)Nishio logic is a specific form of Forcing Chain often described as "hypothesize and check." The solver asks: "If I place candidate $X$ here, does the puzzle break immediately?" If the implications lead to a contradiction (e.g., a cell with no candidates), $X$ is eliminated.7.5 - 8.5: The rating varies based on the complexity of the path to the contradiction.7.6: Nishio Chain (5-6 nodes).7.7: Nishio Chain (7-8 nodes).26. The Era of Constructive Disjunction: Region Forcing (8.0 – 9.0)Beyond simple linear chains, the next tier of difficulty involves Constructive Disjunction. This is the logic of parallel universes: "I don't know if $A$, $B$, or $C$ is true, but in all cases, $Z$ must be true (or false)."6.1 Cell and Region Forcing ChainsThese techniques do not rely on a single linear path. Instead, they require the solver to verify a common outcome across multiple distinct chains originating from a single container.8.0 - 9.0: Cell/Region Forcing Chains.Cell Forcing Chain: Consider a cell with candidates $\{1, 2\}$. Chain A starts with "If 1..."; Chain B starts with "If 2...". If both chains imply that Cell X cannot be 5, then 5 is eliminated.Region Forcing Chain: Consider a Row where digit 5 can be in Column 1, 5, or 9. Three separate chains are simulated. If all three lead to the same elimination, the elimination is valid.The high rating reflects the massive cognitive overhead: the solver must essentially solve three different puzzles mentally to find a common intersection.107. The Recursive Horizon: Dynamic Forcing Chains (8.5 – 10.0+)The term Dynamic in the context of Sudoku Explainer ratings (8.5+) refers to nested implications. In a standard (static) forcing chain, the links are present in the grid at the start. In a Dynamic Forcing Chain (DFC), the links themselves are created by the hypothetical placement of a candidate.7.1 Algorithmic Definition of "Dynamic"When the solver hypothesizes r1c1 = 5, this placement might clear a row, creating a new strong link in r1 that didn't exist before. A dynamic chain utilizes these emergent links. This is effectively "guessing within a guess" or logical recursion.8.5 - 9.5: Dynamic Forcing Chains. The standard tier for nested logic.9.0 - 10.0: Dynamic Forcing Chains (+). The (+) indicates that the nested logic utilizes complex patterns (like Fish or Wings) generated dynamically within the hypothesis.27.2 The Hierarchy of Nested LogicAs the recursion depth increases, the SE rating climbs into the double digits.9.9 - 10.9: DFC (+Forcing Chains). The hypothesis requires a full Forcing Chain to resolve a step.10.8 - 11.5: DFC (+Multiple Forcing Chains).11.4 - 11.9: DFC (+Dynamic Forcing Chains). This is the practical ceiling for most logical solvers. It implies a second-order dynamic recursion: To prove the primary hypothesis leads to a contradiction, the solver enters a sub-hypothesis which itself creates dynamic links.128. Case Studies of The Extreme (10.0 – 12.0)To contextualize these abstract ratings, we must examine specific puzzles that have historically defined the upper bound of the SE scale. These "Monsters" reveal the limits of the SE algorithm.8.1 Platinum Blonde (10.6 – 10.9)Rated between 10.6 and 10.9, this puzzle is a prime example of Dynamic Forcing Chains (+).Analysis: The puzzle requires Multi-Sector Locked Sets (MSLS) and Junior Exocets. However, SE does not have a native "Exocet" module. Instead, it decomposes the Exocet logic into a raw, massive net of dynamic forcing chains. This inflation—rating a pattern-based move as a chaotic network of chains—is a key characteristic of the 10.0+ range.13Chaos Theory: Researchers have used Platinum Blonde to demonstrate "transient chaos" in Sudoku, showing that the solution path exhibits properties of a chaotic dynamical system with a very long escape rate.148.2 Golden Nugget (11.9)For years, Golden Nugget was the standard-bearer for the hardest known Sudoku, rated at 11.9.The 11.9 Ceiling: Why 11.9? This value typically represents the cutoff where Sudoku Explainer's recursion depth limit is hit. It corresponds to a Dynamic Forcing Chain (+Dynamic Forcing Chain) structure. The solver must perform a trial, and within that trial, perform another dynamic trial.Structure: Unlike some difficult puzzles that rely on a single bottleneck, Golden Nugget lacks obvious geometric patterns (like symmetry or diagonal clues), making it resistant to standard heuristic reductions.158.3 Easter Monster (11.9)Easter Monster is another 11.9 puzzle that highlights the "Decomposition Issue."The SK Loop: Human experts can solve Easter Monster using an SK Loop (Stephenson-Kravan Loop), a complex but recognizable pattern of coupled sectors.SE's Blind Spot: Because SE lacks an atomic "SK Loop" technique, it attempts to verify the logic via raw chaining. It forces the solver to construct a "Big Unfinned Mutant Squirmbag" or a massive dynamic net to replicate the SK Loop's eliminations. This results in the maxed-out 11.9 rating, proving that SE ratings at this level often measure the absence of a high-level pattern definition in the software's library rather than raw unsolvability.178.4 The "Pencilmarks" Rating (12.0+)References to ratings of 12.0 - 12.7 (Pencilmarks) refer to puzzles that cannot be solved even with the standard Dynamic Forcing Chain depth. These ratings often imply the use of "Pencilmark" logic (Sukaku constraints) or require recursion depths (T&E level 3+) that SE generally considers effectively infinite or "Guessing".129. Comparative Analysis: SE vs. HoDoKuA critical insight for researchers is the divergence between Sudoku Explainer (SE) and HoDoKu.SE (Peak Difficulty): Rates the puzzle based only on the hardest step. A puzzle with one 9.0 step and twenty 1.0 steps is rated 9.0.HoDoKu (Fatigue): Assigns points to every step and sums them. A puzzle with fifty 4.0 steps might be rated higher than a puzzle with one 8.0 step.This distinction explains why "marketing" difficulty (like AI Escargot) often differs from SE ratings. AI Escargot (SE ~9.8) requires holding "8 causal relationships," which implies broad width (HoDoKu style difficulty), whereas SE looks for the single deepest recursive thread.2010.

Limit of standard SE.11. ConclusionThe Sudoku Explainer rating system serves as the rigorous backbone of Sudoku difficulty analysis. By quantifying difficulty not as a function of time, but as a function of logical depth, it provides a stable taxonomy for the 6.67 sextillion possible Sudoku grids. The exact values—specifically the logarithmic penalties for chain length (6.6 vs 6.9) and the steep penalties for dynamic recursion (8.5+)—reveal that "difficulty" is fundamentally a measure of required working memory and lookahead depth. While the system has limitations, particularly its inability to recognize certain modern patterns like SK Loops as atomic units (leading to the 11.9 inflation seen in Easter Monster), it remains the defining standard for distinguishing the merely "Hard" from the theoretically "Impossible."
