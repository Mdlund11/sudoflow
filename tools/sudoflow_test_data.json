This technique is closely related to 2x1 Finned Sashimi X-Wing technique logic, Coloring technique or L1-Wing technique. It is a subcategory of X-Chains group of techniques which is in itself a subgroup of Alternating Inference Chains (AIC) group of techniques. These use strong links in L ocation inferred from 1 value (L1), therefore, L1-Wing can be used to describe this pattern (Currently L1 is used with 3 strong links only)."

In both configurations, each row, column or block touched by the Unique Rectangle contains each of the two values 2 and 3 exactly once. As a result, if one of these two configurations were part of the solution, it could then be replaced by the other one to get a second valid solution . Because a valid sudoku cannot have more than one solution, none of the two configurations of the Unique Rectangle can be valid.

Any occurrence of the value 4 can be removed from any cells sharing a region or regions with both start and end cells r6c2 and r4c4 . This technique is closely related to 2x1 Finned Sashimi X-Wing technique logic, Coloring technique or L1-Wing technique. It is a subcategory of X-Chains group of techniques which is in itself a subgroup of Alternating Inference Chains (AIC) group of techniques. These use strong links in L ocation inferred from 1 value (L1), therefore, L1-Wing can be used to describe this pattern (Currently L1 is used with 3 strong links only)."

In both configurations, each row, column or block touched by the Unique Rectangle contains each of the two values 4 and 6 exactly once. As a result, if one of these two configurations were part of the solution, it could then be replaced by the other one to get a second valid solution . Because a valid sudoku cannot have more than one solution, none of the two configurations of the Unique Rectangle can be valid. Note that the two cells r5c9 and r5c8 are the only possible positions of the value 4 in the row , thus, one of these two cells will contain the value 4 .

Regardless of the final value of cell r9c5 , the double-link would force the other 5 cells from the pattern to have different values to that one. The 6 different values will be in 6 cells therefore forming a locked set. Other occurrences of any of the values of the Ring pattern can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a row, column or block with all Ring cells containing that value.

This technique is closely related to 2x1 Finned Sashimi X-Wing technique logic, Coloring technique or L1-Wing technique. It is a subcategory of X-Chains group of techniques which is in itself a subgroup of Alternating Inference Chains (AIC) group of techniques. These use strong links in L ocation inferred from 1 value (L1), therefore, L1-Wing can be used to describe this pattern (Currently L1 is used with 3 strong links only)."

Regardless of the final value of cell r4c7 , the double-link would force the other 5 cells from the pattern to have different values to that one. The 6 different values will be in 6 cells therefore forming a locked set. Other occurrences of any of the values of the Ring pattern can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a row, column or block with all Ring cells containing that value. The largest cell of the Ring has 4 candidates and all 5 cells of the ALS have a total of 16 candidates. The pattern is similar to a 6digit-6cell Sue de Coq (SDC)."

These use strong links in L ocation inferred from 1 value (L1), therefore, Grouped L1-Wing can be used to describe this pattern.(Currently, L1 is reserved for 3 strong links). the arrangement of cells with value 1 in row 1, row 7 and row 6 form strong links (conjugate pairs, shown as green values) or grouped strong links (orange cell outline or yellow cell background). These strong links are weakly linked to each other via column 7 and column 6 (Red or Green outlined region). Any occurrence of the value 1 can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a region or regions with ALL cells with value 1 in row 1 and row 6 that are not part of column 7 or column 6 . This technique is part of more generalized technique called X- chains which in itself is part of more generalized technique called Alternating Inference Chains (AIC). This technique uses logic closely related to Finned Swordfish technique logic. The grouped strong link when inferred from cells in a block that are arranged in one mini-row and one mini-column is also known commonly as \"Empty rectangle\". The inference of a strong link from a group of cells with value 1 in any region can be spotted when a an \"Empty mini Area (EmA)\" is observed. This EmA could be an empty mini-Line (EmL) in a region or regions. In the case of \"Empty rectangle\" the EmA is a group of empty cells that can also be referred to as \"Empty mini Rectangle (EmR)\"."

Details of the Forcing Chain: (1) If r4c4 does not contain the value 1, then r4c4 must contain the value 7 (only remaining possible value in the cell) (2) If r4c4 contains the value 7, then r2c4 cannot contain the value 7 (the value can occur only once in the column) (3) If r2c4 does not contain the value 7, then r1c6 must contain the value 7 (only remaining possible position in the block) (4) If r1c6 contains the value 7, then r1c7 cannot contain the value 7 (the value can occur only once in the row) (5) If r1c7 does not contain the value 7, then r1c7 must contain the value 1 (only remaining possible value in the cell) (6) If r1c7 contains the value 1, then r7c7 cannot contain the value 1 (the value can occur only once in the column) (7) If r7c7 does not contain the value 1, then r7c6 must contain the value 1 (only remaining possible position in the row) (8) If r7c6 contains the value 1, then r8c4 cannot contain the value 1 (the value can occur only once in the block) (9) If r8c4 does not contain the value 1, then r4c4 must contain the value 1 (only remaining possible position in the column)"

The value 8 in block 6 and row 7 forms 2 (regional) strong links or conjugate pairs with 1 set(s) of bridge cells in column 7 and column 7 . The 2 strong links are joined therefore with 1 weak link(s). Any occurrence of the value 8 can be removed from any cells sharing a region or regions with both start and end cells r6c8 and r7c6 . This technique is closely related to 2x1 Finned Sashimi X-Wing technique logic, Coloring technique or L1-Wing technique. It is a subcategory of X-Chains group of techniques which is in itself a subgroup of Alternating Inference Chains (AIC) group of techniques. These use strong links in L ocation inferred from 1 value (L1), therefore, L1-Wing can be used to describe this pattern (Currently L1 is used with 3 strong links only)."

        "description": "Grouped 3 Strong links 3012 This technique relies on Conjugate Pairs that infer a strong link and/or a special arrangement of values in a line or block also known as Grouped Strong Links (where a strong link is inferred from groups of cells having the same value). These use strong links in L ocation inferred from 1 value (L1), therefore, Grouped L1-Wing can be used to describe this pattern.(Currently, L1 is reserved for 3 strong links). the arrangement of cells with value 1 in block 8, row 4 and column 9 form strong links (conjugate pairs, shown as green values) or grouped strong links (orange cell outline or yellow cell background). These strong links are weakly linked to each other via column 4 and block 6 (Red or Green outlined region). Any occurrence of the value 1 can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a region or regions with ALL cells with value 1 in block 8 and column 9 that are not part of column 4 or block 6 . This technique is part of more generalized technique called X- chains which in itself is part of more generalized technique called Alternating Inference Chains (AIC). This technique uses logic closely related to Finned Swordfish technique logic. The grouped strong link when inferred from cells in a block that are arranged in one mini-row and one mini-column is also known commonly as \"Empty rectangle\". The inference of a strong link from a group of cells with value 1 in any region can be spotted when a an \"Empty mini Area (EmA)\" is observed. This EmA could be an empty mini-Line (EmL) in a region or regions. In the case of \"Empty rectangle\" the EmA is a group of empty cells that can also be referred to as \"Empty mini Rectangle (EmR)\"."

Regardless of the final value of cell r4c8 , the double-link would force the other 5 cells from the pattern to have different values to that one. The 6 different values will be in 6 cells therefore forming a locked set. Other occurrences of any of the values of the Ring pattern can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a row, column or block with all Ring cells containing that value. The largest cell of the Ring has 4 candidates and all 5 cells of the ALS have a total of 16 candidates. The pattern is similar to a 6digit-6cell Sue de Coq (SDC)."

        "description": "Grouped 3 Skyscrapers 1111 This technique relies on Conjugate Pairs that infer a strong link and/or a special arrangement of values in a line or block also known as Grouped Strong Links (where a strong link is inferred from groups of cells having the same value). These use strong links in L ocation inferred from 1 value (L1), therefore, Grouped L1-Wing can be used to describe this pattern.(Currently, L1 is reserved for 3 strong links). the arrangement of cells with value 1 in row 1, row 7 and row 6 form strong links (conjugate pairs, shown as green values) or grouped strong links (orange cell outline or yellow cell background). These strong links are weakly linked to each other via column 7 and column 5 (Red or Green outlined region). Any occurrence of the value 1 can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a region or regions with ALL cells with value 1 in row 1 and row 6 that are not part of column 7 or column 5 . This technique is part of more generalized technique called X- chains which in itself is part of more generalized technique called Alternating Inference Chains (AIC). This technique uses logic closely related to Finned Swordfish technique logic. The grouped strong link when inferred from cells in a block that are arranged in one mini-row and one mini-column is also known commonly as \"Empty rectangle\". The inference of a strong link from a group of cells with value 1 in any region can be spotted when a an \"Empty mini Area (EmA)\" is observed. This EmA could be an empty mini-Line (EmL) in a region or regions. In the case of \"Empty rectangle\" the EmA is a group of empty cells that can also be referred to as \"Empty mini Rectangle (EmR)\"."

Details of the Forcing Chain: (1) If r4c4 does not contain the value 1, then r4c4 must contain the value 7 (only remaining possible value in the cell) (2) If r4c4 contains the value 7, then r2c4 cannot contain the value 7 (the value can occur only once in the column) (3) If r2c4 does not contain the value 7, then r1c6 must contain the value 7 (only remaining possible position in the block) (4) If r1c6 contains the value 7, then r1c7 cannot contain the value 7 (the value can occur only once in the row) (5) If r1c7 does not contain the value 7, then r1c7 must contain the value 1 (only remaining possible value in the cell) (6) If r1c7 contains the value 1, then r7c7 cannot contain the value 1 (the value can occur only once in the column) (7) If r7c7 does not contain the value 1, then r7c5 must contain the value 1 (only remaining possible position in the row) (8) If r7c5 contains the value 1, then r8c4 cannot contain the value 1 (the value can occur only once in the block) (9) If r8c4 does not contain the value 1, then r4c4 must contain the value 1 (only remaining possible position in the column)"

These strong links are weakly linked to each other via row 7 and row 7 (Red or Green outlined region). Any occurrence of the value 9 can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a region or regions with ALL cells with value 9 in column 2 and column 9 that are not part of row 7 or row 7 . This technique is part of more generalized technique called X- chains which in itself is part of more generalized technique called Alternating Inference Chains (AIC). This technique uses logic closely related to Finned X-Wing technique logic. The grouped strong link when inferred from cells in a block that are arranged in one mini-row and one mini-column is also known commonly as \"Empty rectangle\". The inference of a strong link from a group of cells with value 9 in any region can be spotted when a an \"Empty mini Area (EmA)\" is observed. This EmA could be an empty mini-Line (EmL) in a region or regions. In the case of \"Empty rectangle\" the EmA is a group of empty cells that can also be referred to as \"Empty mini Rectangle (EmR)\"."

Details of the Forcing Chain: (1) If r1c5 contains the value 5, then r1c6 cannot contain the value 5 (the value can occur only once in the block) (2) If r1c6 does not contain the value 5, then r1c6 must contain the value 2 (only remaining possible value in the cell) (3) If r1c6 contains the value 2, then r1c2 cannot contain the value 2 (the value can occur only once in the row) (4) If r1c2 does not contain the value 2, then r4c2 must contain the value 2 (only remaining possible position in the column) (5) If r4c2 contains the value 2, then r4c2 cannot contain the value 5 (the cell can contain only one value) (6) If r4c2 does not contain the value 5, then r4c5 must contain the value 5 (only remaining possible position in the row) (7) If r4c5 contains the value 5, then r1c5 cannot contain the value 5 (the value can occur only once in the column)"

In a BUG, each value that remains in a row, column or block has exactly two possible positions in that row, column or block; and each empty cell has exactly two possible values. A Sudoku having a BUG has zero, two or more valid solutions. Because a valid Sudoku has exactly one solution, the BUG cannot be part of it. The only way to avoid the BUG is if the cell r1c2 contains the value 1 . The values 2 and 9 can therefore be removed."
